When selecting our motors, we wanted to optimize both power and range. Therefore, we focused on having reliable testing infrastructure in this competition year.\nFlight Controller # For our plane this year, we realized that it would be easier to select our avionics components like servos and other sensors first, and select a flight controller(FC) that supports all of our required equipment on the plane. Therefore, we first brainstormed a list of components we wanted the FC to support which included:\n- ELRS Reciever - Telemetry Radio - GPS - Object avoidance electronics - Landing electronics - Controls surface servo ports - Aileron - Flaps - Tails - Steerable landing gear - Kill Switch - Throttle - FPV Camera - Airspeed Sensor(s) We also wanted our FC to be price-efficient, so we considered several options that fit our general requirements:\n- Pix32 v6 - Holybro Pixhawk4 - Pixhawk 6C - Kakute H743 Wing - iFlight BLITZ Wing H743 - Mateksys H743-Wing - SpeedyBeeF405WING We ended up choosing the Mateksys H743-Wing for its wide availability of ports for the aforementioned requirements, and its great compatibility with Ardupilot.\nMotor Selection # Our approach to motor selection this year was a fair bit more involved this year because we wanted to accurately model motor performance in flight. For this, we would need some way of testing the dynamic thrust of motors. We did not have the budget of a full-blown wind-tunnel, so we instead build a rig and software stack that would allow us to the motors on a car.\nThe motor test stand was designed to mount on top of the car, and we designed a custom electronics package that uses an Arduino ESP-32 Nano board to measure the voltage and current pulled by the motors and wirelessly communicates with a laptop.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/electronics/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"Electronics","type":"development"},{"content":"The wing dun dun dun\u0026hellip;.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/fuselage/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"Fuselage","type":"development"},{"content":" We are a team of motivated engineers seeking to apply our knowledge to solve real-world problems.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"Home","type":"page"},{"content":"The wing dun dun dun..\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/landing-gear/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"Landing Gear","type":"development"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" The flight on April 25th was Gita\u0026rsquo;s very first flight, as well as its first crash. After a successful completion of autotune, the switch to FBWA mode resulted in a rapid descent with no ability for climb. Numerous theories were brought up:\nFBWA controls were poorly tuned resulting an inadequate pitch up. The elevator surface area was too low to begin with. The foam horizontal stabilizer failed in air. The servo extensions disconnected. None of the above theories successfully explained the crash. The log files showed the FBWA responding properly. The elevator surface area was adequate for takeoff. The foam horizontal stabilizer was intact after the crash. The servo extensions were verified working, and an additional servo was placed for the elevator for redundancy. The team went on to rebuild the fuselage and the tail surfaces. In this process, the fuselage and tail were both made stronger with more support structures. In the third flight attempt, the aircraft successfully took off and did not seem to have any issues with the pitch. It was almost as if the cause of the crash spontaneously disappeared. However, throughout the flight, the roll authority felt a bit off: it would oscillate in FBWA mode, despite the roll being tuned.\nWhile going through the team\u0026rsquo;s safety checklist, one of the aileron servos was discovered to malfunction: it would work only intermittently. Sometimes, the elevator would also fail to work. Only after calling the flight off and taking the flight controller off the plane was the problem discovered: poorly soldered joints. Several of the servo pins, particularly those connected to aileron and elevator, lacked solder.\nResoldering the joints, Gita XI 12 took off again, this time with no roll nor pitch issues.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/the-maiden-flight/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"The Maidien Flight(And Crash)","type":"development"},{"content":"The wing dun dun dun\u0026hellip;.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/the-wing/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"The Wing","type":"development"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/turibius-rozario/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Turibius Rozario","type":"authors"}]
