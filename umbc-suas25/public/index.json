[{"content":" For the test flights of Gita XI 12 we had to transport the aircraft from UMBC to a model airfield about 20 minutes away, and with a wing 8 feet in length and a fuselage of a similar length, disassembly was required for transport. For the first test flight, we only had to detach the wing from the fuselage in order to transport it, on arrival reattach the wing and do all safety checks to ensure our connections. The first flight had over 8 people working on reassembly and setup, and yet we noticed that there were some inefficiencies in our design that lead to losing hours to assembly. We struggled accessing the flight controller, making connecting the wires tedious and difficult. During transport the tail was prone to bumping and damage during transport due to it remaining attached. Also the wing took too much time to be balanced and connected to the fuselage. However, after the crash that came from that flight we had a chance to rebuild the fuselage, and add the features to make assembly even faster.\nUpon rebuilding the fuselage, we added a new tail connected by two screws to the boom allowing for it to be slid off. Allowing for less risk of damage to the tail during transport, and quick reattaching upon arrival. Also we added multiple doors to the sides of the fuselage, allowing for quick access to any of the electronics inside, and for quick troubleshooting during test flight sessions. We also made 3d printed casings for the four screws attaching the wing to the fuselage, this allowed for a snug fit and easy adjustments during our flight sessions.\nOn our first flight after completing those changes we were able to completely reassemble, setup, and prepare the plane for flight safety checks in under 20 minutes. With less than half the original number or members working on it. In the amount of time it took for us to set up and assemble the plane on the first flight, we were able to be in the air in less time during our subsequent flights.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/assembly-and-dissasembly/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"Assembly and Disassembly","type":"development"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":" The Gita XI 12 communicates with the ground station using the MAVLink (Micro Air Vehicle Link) protocol.\nMAVLink is a lightweight, long ranged and open source communication protocol used in drones and unmanned vehicles. A unique advantage this protocol presents is its bi-directional communication capabilities. This allows the ground control station to send radio controls to manually pilot the aerial unit while receiving live time telemetry data such as air speed, altitude, pitch, distance travelled, GPS etc at the same time. The signal strength is constantly monitored by a heartbeat protocol, which is used to advertise the existence of a system on the MAVLink network, along with its system and component id, vehicle type, flight stack, component type, and flight mode (Mavlink np).\nThe Mavlink Long Range Signal (MAVLink LRS) is the radio system that allows communication through the MAVLink protocol over long distances (10km - 100km). The Mateksys Transmitter and Receiver modules used in the GITA XI 12 utilizes the LoRa (Long Range) hardware to achieve this range. MLRS supports full-duplex (bi-directional) connection. Therefore, even though the aerial and ground units are traditionally called receivers and transmitters consecutively, both essentially are transceivers.\nMavlink is used on this aircraft instead of other communication systems because it provides long range stable and bidirectional connection allowing both RC controls and telemetry communication to happen using the same equipment. Mavlink additionally provides more safety in case of accidental communication issues. For example, if the Ground Control System (GCS) connection is lost, the manual controls remain unaffected and the GCS is able to recover telemetry without restarting the flight controller. Usage of the specific hardware on the Gita XI 12 also allows wireless connection between the transmitter and the GCS, keeping navigation uncomplicated for the safety pilot.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/communications/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"Communications","type":"development"},{"content":" Figuring out the fuselage for the Gita XI 12 definitely involved a lot of trial and error. Since we were using foam, it was pretty forgiving. At first we made a smooth, curved fuselage thinking it would help with aerodynamics. But after our initial plane crashed, we took a step back and realized that a boxy fuselage could perform just as well and would be much easier to build, fix, and fit with components.\nWe started the process by building the internal ribs of the fuselage. These ribs helped define the structure of the plane and set the spacing for key components like the wings, electronics, and tail. Once the ribs were made, we designed the fuselage shape to wrap around them. This meant the outer foam shell had to match the width and height of the ribs, which gave us a custom-fit body that supported everything inside while keeping things lightweight.\nThe size of the fuselage was also based on the layout of the plane. We used a simple method to figure out how much fuselage we needed in front of the wing. By taking the distance from the wing to the tail and multiplying it by two-thirds, we found a length that worked well for balance and stability.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/fuselage-creation/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"Creating the Fuselage","type":"development"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"Development","type":"development"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/documentation/","section":"Documentation","summary":"","title":"Documentation","type":"documentation"},{"content":" Introduction # When selecting electronic components for our plane, we wanted to make sure that they worked over the entire range of the flight while also being easy to configure. When selecting our motors, we wanted to optimize both power and range. Therefore, we focused on having reliable testing infrastructure in this competition year.\nFlight Controller # For our plane this year, we realized that it would be easier to select our avionics components like servos and other sensors first, and select a flight controller (FC) that supports all of our required equipment on the plane. Therefore, we first brainstormed a list of components we wanted the FC to support which included:\n- ELRS Reciever - Telemetry Radio - GPS - Object avoidance electronics - Landing electronics - Controls surface servo ports - Aileron - Flaps - Tails - Steerable landing gear - Kill Switch - Throttle - FPV Camera - Airspeed Sensor(s) We also wanted our FC to be price-efficient, so we considered several options that fit our general requirements:\n- Pix32 v6 - Holybro Pixhawk4 - Pixhawk 6C - Kakute H743 Wing - iFlight BLITZ Wing H743 - Mateksys H743-Wing - SpeedyBeeF405WING We ended up choosing the Mateksys H743-Wing for its wide availability of ports for the aforementioned requirements, and its great compatibility with Ardupilot.\nMotor Selection # Our approach to motor selection this year was a fair bit more involved this year because we wanted to accurately model motor performance in flight. For this, we would need some way of testing the dynamic thrust of motors. We did not have the budget of a full-blown wind-tunnel, so we instead build a rig and software stack that would allow us to the motors on a car.\nThe motor test stand was designed to mount on top of the car, and we designed a custom electronics package that uses an Arduino ESP-32 Nano board to measure the voltage and current pulled by the motors and wirelessly communicates with a laptop. The electronics package sends the data over a UDP stream to synchronize data in real time with accurate timestamp. This data can then be plotted to help analyze motor performance like thrust and efficiency.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/electronics/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"Electronics","type":"development"},{"content":"Throughout our preparations for the competition this year, my responsibilities primarily involved hardware-related assembly. Specifically, I did many of the soldering required for the electrical components of the aircraft, including the flight-controller, GPS, LiDAR system, and RC receiver. This also involved consulting wiring diagrams to ensure that all pins and connections were in their correct places, as well as configuring software to allow for proper functionality, such as writing firmware to the flight controller. Further, having had prior soldering experience, I ensured that the aircraft’s solder joints appeared strong and re-did any improper connections as an important aspect of safety and reliability in the air.\nFlight-Controller Connections: # The flight-controller is the most major electronic component of the aircraft, as it connects to each of the aircraft’s servos, speed controller signal outputs, and peripherals. This necessitated custom-made wiring harnesses and connectors to meet the needs for our particular aircraft and its configuration. For example, the cable that was included for our LiDAR module needed to be lengthened to fit the aircraft and was incompatible with the flight controller we used, as its wires required pins at the ends in order to connect properly. To solve this, I spliced properly-lengthed wires to the ends of the connector to the module and attached pin headers to the other sides, ensuring that the connections were adequately strong and could connect to the correct locations on the flight-controller itself.\nIn addition to this, the flight controller originally had cold solder joints (solder joints made without enough heat, causing incomplete melting) for its power connectors. I made sure to redo these connections as an early step in our building process.\nThe cold solder joins are shown on the left. The fixed joints are shown on the right. Wiring the Radio Receiver: # Similarly to the LiDAR system, the RC receiver for our aircraft needed to be wired to the flight controller using pins. I used a similar approach to before by attaching pin headers to wires, except by soldering the wires directly to the receiver due to its design lacking pin connections.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/documentation/electronics/","section":"Documentation","summary":"","title":"Electronics Connections","type":"documentation"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/gabriel/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Gabriel","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/kai/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Kai","type":"authors"},{"content":" With the flight readiness review just two weeks away, and the previous rear landing gear broken, the team needed to ensure the next rear landing gear does not fail. 32 layers of plain weave carbon fiber were laid on a smooth glass surface, and laminated with slow-cure resin. A 3D printed mold was assembled, and layers of plastic, breather fabric, and perforated release film were added. The wet carbon fiber were laid into the mold, and the mold was clamped shut. After 48 hours of curing, the mold was opened. The mold came off cleanly, and no excess epoxy was left in the landing gear.\nSeveral steps had to be done to get the landing gear ready. First, the numerous sharp edges and corners had to be cut off. A metal bandsaw was used to cut the landing gear outside, while constantly utilizing a vacuum to suck away harmful carbon fiber dust. Holes were made to fit two 4\u0026quot; wheels on the sides, and 4 holes in the core to mount to the fuselage. The most important and thrilling part of the production was, of course, the testing. The rear landing gear must be capable of surviving hard emergency landings. The project lead intern volunteered to test: applying his full body weight onto the rear landing gear, hard sharp sounds were heard. Those were the sounds of the landing gear deforming to hold the weight; deforming to sustain 140 pounds of force without damage. The team successfully verified that the minimum maximum load capacity of the rear landing gear is 140 pounds; 7 times greater than the weight of the aircraft. The true maximum is yet to be found.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/landing-gear/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"Landing Gear","type":"development"},{"content":" Due to the design decision of making the plane a dual motor powered aircraft, wing affixed motor mounts are required to ensure a proper connection to the aircraft, for both safety and the functionality of the plane. Since these motor mounts had to be very strong as well as light, carbon fiber was chosen. With the complex geometry of an airfoil, 3D printed molds were used to manufacture the Carbon Fiber mounts of both the top and bottom side of the wing to ensure a strong mount. Using 8 layer of plain weave carbon fiber was used by laminating them with a slow-cure resin, press molded between layers of plastic, breather fabric, and perforated release film to remove excess resin as well as protect the 3D printed molds for ease of disassembly and reuse. After 48 hours of curing, the plastic, and breather fabric is removed the carbon fiber motor mounts are ready for negative manufacturing. By cutting holes and smoothing the edges, we can make the motor mount safe to touch with the bare hand as well as ready to combine to be used on the wing of the aircraft.\nWith the carbon fiber mounts ready to be attached to the wing with two m6 bolts, a way to power the motors is necessary. Since a way to attach the battery is needed and the bolts are necessary to attach the motor mounts to the wing, it was seen to be the best idea to attach the battery mount to the motor mounts. Because the location of the batteries would be inline with the motor mount, a slipstream effect would help decrease the drag of the aircraft as well as make it easier to attach and detach the batteries for both safety and quick “refueling” of the plane between missions. By bolting a flat piece of flexible wood to the motor mount with a spacer between the motor mount and the battery mount, a very solid connection is made. Since the battery needed to be separated from the protruding bolt nuts, a second flat piece of wood was added on top of spacers to separate both slabs of wood. Now Velcro was attached to the bottom of the flat wood, and the battery is attached to the Velcro, using a strap between the motor mount and the battery mount that goes around the battery, compressing the wood and battery together, ensuring that the wood doesn\u0026rsquo;t fail to shear stress, as the first design tested failed under load because of the weak tensile properties of plywood, securing the battery to the mount ensuring that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t fall off the plane which would be a safety concern if not secured.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/manufacturing/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"Manufacturing","type":"development"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/murali/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Murali","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/nowrin/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Nowrin","type":"authors"},{"content":" One of the tasks for the SUAS competition is to drop a payload, an LED beacon, onto a designated target. To do so requires may components including, but not limited to, the servo used to pull and push a pin used to drop the payload, the hatch that closes after the payload has left the aircraft to decrease drag after drop, and the mechanism used to slow the payload down upon decent by increasing drag while maintaining stability and direction.\nThe servo mechanism uses a servo arm to pull a pin that is attached to the payload, this pin once pulled detaches the LED beacon from the plane using gravity. Using the Venturi effect, the hatch on the bottom of the plane that is propped open by the payload, closes automatically after the payload leaves the aircraft by using the high speed and low pressure air to suck the hatch closed, decreasing pressure drag of the aircraft. The stabilization and velocity reduction of the payload is paramount to ensuring a slow and accurate landing of the LED. This stabilization and high drag component of our payloads coincide with each other because the high drag on the top side of the payload stabilizes the LED while also slowing it down enough not to break on impact.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/payload/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"Payload Delivery","type":"development"},{"content":" Before any flight, we have to make sure the aircraft is completely ready, and for the Gita XI 12, that means going through a full list of important checks. Over the course of testing Gita we have learned how critical it is to understand every part of the plane and how it responds before taking off.\nOne of the first things we always look at is the control surfaces. We check that the ailerons, elevator, and rudder move freely and correctly. There should not be any strange noises or stiffness when they are moved through their full range. Next is the power system. We test the engine to make sure it starts properly and runs smoothly. We watch for any unusual vibrations and confirm that it responds to throttle changes the way it should. We also monitor engine temperatures to make sure they stay within safe limits.\nThe electrical system and avionics are another big part of the check. We confirm that the battery is charged and that all systems like GPS, telemetry, and safety features are working. If anything is not responding or has weak signals, we fix it before doing anything else.\nStructural checks are just as important. We inspect the landing gear and look over the body of the plane for any signs of damage or wear. We make sure everything is aligned correctly and that there is no stress on the plane that could cause a problem later.\nWe then check the center of gravity of the plane, making sure that our plane has the best chance at flying well. After the plane has been determined to have a perfect center of gravity (25% in our case) we move on to our thrust tests which helps ensure that our plane can reach the speeds that it needs to. These checks might seem routine, but doing them carefully is what makes flight testing safe and successful. With the Gita XI 12, every step helps us learn more and get closer to full flight readiness.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/documentation/safety-checks/","section":"Documentation","summary":"","title":"Safety Checks","type":"documentation"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/shrikanth/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Shrikanth","type":"authors"},{"content":" Previous Nextsads ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sponsors/","section":"UMBC SUAS 2025","summary":"","title":"Sponsors","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" The flight on April 25th was Gita\u0026rsquo;s very first flight, as well as its first crash. After a successful completion of autotune, the switch to FBWA mode resulted in a rapid descent with no ability for climb. Numerous theories were brought up:\nFBWA controls were poorly tuned resulting an inadequate pitch up. The elevator surface area was too low to begin with. The foam horizontal stabilizer failed in air. The servo extensions disconnected. None of the above theories successfully explained the crash. The log files showed the FBWA responding properly. The elevator surface area was adequate for takeoff. The foam horizontal stabilizer was intact after the crash. The servo extensions were verified working, and an additional servo was placed for the elevator for redundancy. The team went on to rebuild the fuselage and the tail surfaces. In this process, the fuselage and tail were both made stronger with more support structures. In the third flight attempt, the aircraft successfully took off and did not seem to have any issues with the pitch. It was almost as if the cause of the crash spontaneously disappeared. However, throughout the flight, the roll authority felt a bit off: it would oscillate in FBWA mode, despite the roll being tuned.\nWhile going through the team\u0026rsquo;s safety checklist, one of the aileron servos was discovered to malfunction: it would work only intermittently. Sometimes, the elevator would also fail to work. Only after calling the flight off and taking the flight controller off the plane was the problem discovered: poorly soldered joints. Several of the servo pins, particularly those connected to aileron and elevator, lacked solder.\nResoldering the joints, Gita XI 12 took off again, this time with no roll nor pitch issues.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/the-maiden-flight/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"The Maiden Flight(And Crash)","type":"development"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/turibius/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Turibius","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"UMBC SUAS 2025","summary":"","title":"UMBC SUAS 2025","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/will/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Will","type":"authors"}]
