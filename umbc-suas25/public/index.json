When selecting our motors, we wanted to optimize both power and range. Therefore, we focused on having reliable testing infrastructure in this competition year.\nRequirements # For our plane this year, we realized that it would be easier to select our avionics components like servos and other sensors first, and select a flight controller(FC) that supports all of our required equipment on the plane. Therefore, we first brainstormed a list of components we wanted the FC to support which included:\n- ELRS Reciever - Telemetry Radio - GPS - Object avoidance electronics - Landing electronics - Controls surface servo ports - Aileron - Flaps - Tails - Steerable landing gear - Kill Switch - Throttle - FPV Camera - Airspeed Sensor(s) We also wanted our FC to be price-efficient, so we considered several options that fit our general requirements:\n- Pix32 v6 - Holybro Pixhawk4 - Pixhawk 6C - Kakute H743 Wing - iFlight BLITZ Wing H743 - Mateksys H743-Wing - SpeedyBeeF405WING We ended up choosing the Mateksys H743-Wing for its wide availability of ports for the aforementioned requirements, and its great compatibility with Ardupilot.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/electronics/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"Electronics","type":"development"},{"content":"The wing dun dun dun\u0026hellip;.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/fuselage/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"Fuselage","type":"development"},{"content":" We are a team of motivated engineers seeking to apply our knowledge to solve real-world problems.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"Home","type":"page"},{"content":"The wing dun dun dun..\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/landing-gear/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"Landing Gear","type":"development"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"The wing dun dun dun\u0026hellip;.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/development/the-wing/","section":"Development","summary":"","title":"The Wing","type":"development"}]
