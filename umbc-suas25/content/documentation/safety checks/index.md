Before any flight, we have to make sure the aircraft is completely ready, and for the Gita XI 12, that means going through a full list of important checks. Over the course of testing Gita we have learned how critical it is to understand every part of the plane and how it responds before taking off. 

One of the first things we always look at is the control surfaces. We check that the ailerons, elevator, and rudder move freely and correctly. There should not be any strange noises or stiffness when they are moved through their full range. Next is the power system. We test the engine to make sure it starts properly and runs smoothly. We watch for any unusual vibrations and confirm that it responds to throttle changes the way it should. We also monitor engine temperatures to make sure they stay within safe limits.

The electrical system and avionics are another big part of the check. We confirm that the battery is charged and that all systems like GPS, telemetry, and safety features are working. If anything is not responding or has weak signals, we fix it before doing anything else. 

Structural checks are just as important. We inspect the landing gear and look over the body of the plane for any signs of damage or wear. We make sure everything is aligned correctly and that there is no stress on the plane that could cause a problem later.

We then check the center of gravity of the plane, making sure that our plane has the best chance at flying well. After the plane has been determined to have a perfect center of gravity (25% in our case) we move on to our thrust tests which helps ensure that our plane can reach the speeds that it needs to. 
These checks might seem routine, but doing them carefully is what makes flight testing safe and successful. With the Gita XI 12, every step helps us learn more and get closer to full flight readiness.
